## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox in practice, despite it being a simple application, I had the opportunity to apply what I learned in this project.

### Continued development

I want to learn more complex ways to apply flexbox, and I also want to learn more about CSS, better ways to apply its properties as well as my HTML semantics, and soon I intend to start learning and applying JavaScript in my projects.
